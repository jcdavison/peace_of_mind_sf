  "I have studied Jeet Kune Do under Sifu Tim Richards since April 2011. In the beginning, I was afraid I might miss if I ever tried to punch someone, and I would have surely become frozen and/or got knocked out if anyone came at me very aggressively. With his guidance, I have learned to be much more calm in potentially violent situations, and I have gained a great deal of confidence about my ability to deal with physical conflict out on the streets of San Francisco. I used to work in the Tenderloin and this training made walking through that neighborhood much more manageable. I would say I even became more bold and able to confront situations more directly rather than passively move away and ignore things that didn't seem right. Life changes a lot when one is no longer afraid of physical conflict. Knowing your body, its limitations, and strengths is advantageous. 
Because he is also a personal trainer, I continue to learn a great deal about the body from Tim. Because of him, I became more lean and more athletic than I've ever been in my life at the age of 33."<div align="right"><i class='orange'>- Andrew Hageman, Oct 2015, Service Industry Revenue Manager</i></div>

  "I have been training with Tim, since the beginning of this year, first starting off with the physical training to get back in shape then moving on to the martial arts. What i really liked about Tim's approach is that he incorporates and encompasses a complete body and mind foundation. He drives in the importance of proper nutrition as well as keeping up at home with the basic training tenants that he teaches you.

  Tim works with you during the orientation process to establish your goals and derives a personalized training regiment from there. Having just been working with him for little over half a year , I have felt the best and the healthiest I have in years. Tim is great about working at your personal pace and knows when to push and when to pull back. He has given me knowledge of exercises i can do anytime and any place which are as effective if not more than some expensive gym and equipment.

  The Jeet Kune Do has been extremely fun and watching Tim and his mastery of these various martial arts as well as training under someone of his caliber has been a great privilege. I look forward to my days training with him and am much more confident not only in mind but in body as well. 

  There are a great group of people who go to the small group classes and Andrew (Tim's Assistant) is top notch as well.

  I consider Tim not only my Sifu and Mentor but also a friend. Its hard not to be affected by Tim's energy.

  If you are looking for either personalized training or martial arts I highly recommend giving Tim a call and going to the orientation. 

  The only drawback is I wish i could go everyday. :)"<div align="right" class='orange'><i class='orange'>- Dennis Gwinn, Sep 2013, Sound Engineer and Professional Promoter</i></div>

  "Tim Richard's training methods have been wonderful for my son.  There is a certain magic Tim's teaching has that really helps children focus while learning about their body's ability to move.  Tim employs a huge variety of training tools so the kids are always excited to see what's next.  His energy and enthusiasm make each class an adventure!  Whether one-on-one or group participation, I cannot recommend his sessions highly enough."

  Jake:  "Do we have training with Tim today?"  Me:  "Yes"  Jake: "Awesome.  That means Wednesday's my favorite day!"  It is Jake's favorite of everything he does, and he is a busy kid.  Basketball, soccer, baseball, swimming, even skiing - he'd rather be "training with Tim".  He is learning self-defense and focus in a fun, movement-filled setting, and these skills help with all of his other pursuits.

  "A couple of months ago I decided that i wanted to make a change in my life. I wanted it to be a complete change. I knew that there were many different people out there that were physical trainers.. but i felt that I wanted more. 
  I didn't just want someone to watch as I lifted weights. I thought that I could go anywhere for that. What really appealed to me about Tim and Peace of Mind was that his approach dealt with the my entire being. I had many questions about nutrition and how that effected my daily mental state. I felt embarrassed when I told Tim that I really had no idea how to eat... even though I am a 33 year old man. Tim put me at ease and explained the ins-and-outs of nutrition and how to eat... and just not what to eat. It has changed the way that I interact with food to the core... and I feel that it is one of the main reasons that i have been able to maintain an amazing positive attitude during some pretty trying times. 

  One of the things that I was really impressed with right off the bat was that Tim invited me down for a free 90-minute introductory session. We went through some of the basics of nutrition and really put my mind at ease. It is pretty intimidating going into a trainers space not really knowing what to expect.... but Tim put me in a great place. He also put me through some tests so that he could asses some of my weaknesses so that he could tailor my workouts around them. It let me know that Tim was really looking out for me and was concerned with my goals. 

  It has been a couple of months now and I have to say that I look forward to working with Tim every week. I can see the changes in my body that I have always wanted.. and now with Tim's help am working for. I have put into practice Tim's teachings and have noticed improvements in my balance, body composition, knowledge or random muscle groups, and overall health and well being.

  I consider Tim a friend and much more then a trainer. I would recommend Tim and Peace of Mind to anyone who is new to fitness and would like to achieve a better understanding of the whole concept."<div align="right"><i class='orange'>- Richie Fredell, May 2013, EMT</i></div>

  "I first started training with Tim about three months ago.  In the dim and distant past I had trained in Japanese Martial arts and even though it has been more than twenty years, I was very drawn to a training session that I saw Tim delivering.

  Tim is extremely thorough.  He took the time to ensure that I was physically capable to undertake the training.  This is especially important since being older now - I am not as supple or strong as I used to be.  He also emphasizes the importance of nutrition and general fitness as an integral part of the training and life in general.

  The training that Tim offers is quite honestly breathtaking in its scope and structure. It focuses the mind and body on a highly dynamic art. It is mentally stimulating and demanding as it requires you to think about movement and reaction to things that happen in real life. Jeet Kune Do is a mixed martial art and pulls from many different styles - so I find myself having so stay alert as we dynamically switch from one style to another.

  Tim is an excellent instructor and breaks down the mechanics of all the areas leaving you with a great understanding during training.

  I would quite honestly recommend Tim as an instructor and personal trainer to anyone."<div align="right"><i class='orange'>- Priyanta Dharmasena, Mar 2013, Bay Area Software Engineer</i></div>

  I've been training with Tim for about four months in a combination of personal
  training and martial arts practice. Tim's knowledge and enthusiasm make for a
  great experience. Whether it's working on strength, flexibility, agility, he is
  conscious of both your strengths and weaknesses tailors the experience to make
  sure you are getting the most out of your time with him. On the martial arts
  side of the training, the things he teaches are immediately applicable in
  serious situations that you hope you will never encounter, but if you did, would
  be much better prepared to defend yourself and/or your family. He keeps it
  interesting, changing from art to art, and balancing between self protection and
  self perfection.

    "Though I have only trained with Tim briefly, I have already seen significant improvements both in my abilities as a martial artist and in my physical well-being. Having been sidelined with a nasty, three-part leg injury for the last year and a half that has precluded my training or teaching martial arts, I have seen numerous physical therapists, physiotherapists, and practitioners of sports medicine, but it was Tim who gave me the final piece of the puzzle that has gotten me back on my feet again. His extensive personal experience with injuries no doubt helped him to truly relate to my predicament, put himself in my shoes, and offer solutions that would build up exactly the right muscles and tendons without putting unnecessary stress on the other points of injury. As a result, I am back to working out twice a day and teaching again, in addition to regularly enjoying Tim's thoroughly studied approach to martial arts, which continues to fill in the holes in my own martial education.

  "If you would like to learn about yourself and feel better then you ever have before, then meet Tim.  Every time I connect with Tim, the rest of my day is great.   He teaches you to be more in tune with yourself, and your body.  I have a shoulder problem and he has come up with my own personal sets of strength training routines to improve my weaknesses.  So if you are like me and you want to accomplish knowledge of the self, health and feeling positive, Tim is the person for you."<div align="right"><i class='orange'>- April Fredrickson, Apr 2011, Bay Area Artist</i></div>

  Tim has been training me in disciplines of self-defense for 3 years now and I find that he is extremely knowledgeable and has a great passion for training. His techniques have real life applications and provide great full-body conditioning as well. I highly recommend Tim's services for anyone wanting to get in shape or learn highly effective self-defense techniques. <div align="right"><i class='orange'>- Cody Hoyer, Fall 2008, Service Industry Revenue Manager</i></div>

  To witness Tim in action would broaden your positive impression considerably: he is at once an inspiring teacher, a charismatic dignitary, a prudent businessman, a good listener, and a prolific martial artist. <div align="right"><i class='orange'>- Duane Kenney, 2006, Sales Executive at Taylor Made</i></div>

  I have worked with Tim Richards in a variety of roles and settings - one of his greatest assets I have observed is diligence and positivity regardless of the circumstances. As a teacher of martial arts and self defense, Tim has guided me through the principals of Jeet Kune Do and boxing. As a personal trainer Tim has introduced me to engaging and vitalizing athletic activities and encouraged me to excel. Tim's commitment and high energy are infectious - he keeps his students excited and focused through those tough workouts. His experience with a massive array of exercise practices keep things interesting, and he's able to find just the right thing for each individual. Add to that his knowledge of sports nutrition and how to recover from a tough workout, and you've found someone who can take you to the next level - whether you're looking to lose weight and tone, or become the athlete of your dreams!
