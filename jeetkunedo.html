    "Jeet Kune Do is training and discipline towards the ultimate reality in combat.
    Jeet Kune Do is the only non-classical style of Chinese Kung Fu in existence today. It is simple in its execution, although not so simple to explain. Jeet means 'to stop, to stem, to intercept,' while Kune means 'fist' or 'style,' and Do means 'the way' or 'the ultimate reality.' In other words--'The Way of the Intercepting Fist.'"

  <div class="display-copy">
    Jeet Kune Do is the name Bruce Lee gave to his own personal theories and principles on streetfighting. This method of training will teach you how to function out of all 4 ranges of fighting  Kicking, Punching, Trapping, and Grappling. My goal is to help you become a well-rounded fighter who can adapt to any range, opponent, or situation. This is accomplished by providing you with a blend of various training modalities designed to increase your attribute level and fighting skill. This is not a random mixture of martial arts but rather a series of proven training methods developed by Sijo Bruce Lee, Guro Dan Inosanto, Sigung Paul Vunak, and Professor James Hundon.

    Rapid Assault Tactics was developed for U.S. Navy SEAL Team 6 as a primary combative program based in Jeet Kune Do concepts. The R.A.T. system places an emphasis on self-preservation using a realistic fighting structure that is designed to neutralize a bigger and stronger opponent.  Rapid Assault Tactics focuses on identifying the phase or range in which an attack situation is occurring and teaches you how to respond to the threat with the  appropriate tools. These tools and techniques are comprised of simple and efficient responses that can be relied on during the "fog" of battle. A special quality of the PFS system is the development of emotional control while working in high stress, reality-based conditions. Today, the R.A.T. system is taught to Special Forces, Military, FBI, DEA, CIA, U.S. Secret Service, SWAT, and over 50 police Departments in the U.S. and other countries.

      Dynamic Small Circle Ju Trap Boxing
    </h2>

  <div class='top-margined centered'>

  </div>

  <div class="display-copy">
    In 2013 Tim received his certification to teach Small Circle Ju Trap Boxing, and became the first affilate school of Universal Martial Arts Academy. Small Circle Ju Trap Boxing was developed by Professor James Hundon as a synthesis of his extensive experience in the martial arts, the security industry, and training law enforcement professionals.
  </div>

  <div class="display-copy">
  Ju Trap Boxing stays true to its root of Small Circle Jujitsu, while incorporating fundamentals of boxing, Jeet Kune Do and Filipino martial arts into a comprehensive, practical approach to self-defense. It teaches us to be comfortable defending ourselves in all fighting ranges - using strikes and traps to nullify the attack, and finishing with jujitsu when in close contact. An emphasis is placed on understanding locking entries while moving and transitioning. Techniques are taught as drills that enhance muscle memory, timing, and ease of use.
  </div>

  <div class="display-copy">
  Ju Trap Boxing also teaches us philosophical principles that apply to our everyday lives as much as to self defense situations. How do we learn to adapt to sudden changes? How do we take control of situations? How do we focus on the positive and discard the negative? The ultimate focus of Ju Trap Boxing is to blend, adapt and become one with the challenges we are faced with in life - whether physical, mental or spiritual. In this journey towards spiritual balance we also find our own personal expression.

    Filipino Martial Arts (Kali) is an extremely effective, battle tested, weapons based system. The bulk of your training in this art will be with weapons such as the stick, knife, and staff. I also teach various empty hand systems that are taken from this dynamic and functional art that will more than compliment your JKD concepts training. The training methods of the Filipino Martial Arts will increase your empty hand skills by supercharging such attributes as coordination, perception, and awareness. One of the main goals of training in this system is the ability it will give you to pick up everyday objects and use them to your advantage. Your car keys, umbrella, the chair your sitting on, the belt or jacket you are wearing, all of these are weapons in the hand of a skilled Filipino Martial Arts practitioner. There is no substitute for the confidence that comes from knowing you can handle what ever may happen.

      JKD Guiding Principles
    </h2>
  </div>

  <div class='display-copy'>
    Jeet Kune Do approaches effective self defense in a uniquely different manner which sets it apart from most other Martial Arts. Some distinctive principles are noted with a brief description.
  </div>


  <div class='display-copy'>
    <span class='orange'>Non Telegraphic Movement</span> - Drawing the arm back before striking, stepping before kicking or showing any obvious "build up" movement tells the opponent what you're about to do. This gives them the opportunity to counter attack you. We learn to punch and kick efficiently without telegraphing our intentions.
  </div>

  <div class='display-copy'>
    <span class='orange'>Strong Side Forward</span> - We stress the use of our strongest and most coordinated weapons (Hand and Foot) out front, where they can do the most damage. If you are right handed, you will be in a right lead fighting stance. If you are left handed, it's a left lead fighting stance. This in turn makes the weaker weapons stronger, giving you two strong sides to use for attack. We use the lead hand for 80% offense, 20% defense. The rear hand is mostly used as a defensive tool, 80% defense, 20% offense.
  </div>

  <div class='display-copy'>
    <span class='orange'>Longest Weapon To The Closest Target</span> - When attacking from a distance to the nearest target, JKD uses the lead hand for punching and the lead leg for kicking. The rear tools are further away, take longer to get to the target and can be countered more easily.
  </div>

  <div class='display-copy'>
    <span class='orange'>Non Classical Movement</span> - We do not employ the use of set or fixed training forms or patterns. They do not accurately represent realistic fight situations. We employ drills that keep the relationship between the opponents alive, fluid and mobile.
  </div>

  <div class='display-copy'>
    <span class='orange'>Use Of Broken Rhythm</span> - Used while attacking or counter attacking, it allows you to catch your opponent while they are motion set, thus making it harder for them to defend or counter your attack. In attacking, there are a few ways to break the rhythm within a series of movements after a rhythm has already been established. For example, speed up suddenly, slow down suddenly, and/or insert a brief pause or delay in the series of movements. In counter attacking, you can hit on the half-beat to break an opponent's rhythm and interrupt their attack. If you hit the opponent before he completes the first strike, you've hit on the half-beat. If you parry the first strike, and hit between the first and second strikes, you have broken the rhythm on the one and a half-beat. Control the rhythm, you can control the fight.
  </div>

  <div class='display-copy'>
    <span class='orange'>Adaptability</span> - Fights are abstract and are constantly changing. One must be able to adapt to these changing situations. You cannot be bound by fixed techniques, a single system or method. You must be free to use whatever works and to express yourself without limitations.
  </div>

  <div class='display-copy'>
    <span class='orange'>Use Of Feints and False Attacks</span> - Feints are actions that make an opponent think an attack is being launched against them. The object is to divert their attention from your final or intended point of attack. False attacks are intentionally made to fall short of a target and to draw a defensive reaction from the opponent. This will help you discover how they will react to your movements and is a set up for other types of attacks, such as Attack by Combination and Progressive Indirect Attack.
  </div>

  <div class='display-copy'>
    <span class='orange'>Interception</span> - The words Jeet Kune Do translate to "Way of The Intercepting Fist." It is least efficient to block first, then hit. It's more efficient to simultaneously parry and hit, or even better, intercept the attack. This is best accomplished by controlling the distance so your opponent has to move towards you to get to you. The mind-set of defend and hit must be changed to "think hit."
  </div>

  <div class='display-copy'>
    <span class='orange'>Centerline</span> - Looping or grand movements are very telegraphic and easy to defend or intercept. Strikes going down the centerline are difficult to see and defend against. There are some major targets located along the centerline such as the eyes, nose, chin, throat, solar plexus and groin. In controlling the centerline, you also can control the balance, position and leverage of an opponent and their ability to attack you.
  </div>

  <div class='display-copy'>
    <span class='orange'>Alive Footwork</span> - Good mobility is essential. It can put you in a position to hit, or it can take you out of position from being hit. Distance, rhythm and timing are controlled with footwork, which should always be alive, fluid and mobile.
    Focus on Low Line Kicking - Kicking high to head in street fights can be dangerous. High kicks are slower, easier to defend, more telegraphic and you need to be very limber to execute them. Low line kicks to the groin, knee and shin are quite effective and much safer to execute. They are also faster, harder to defend, less telegraphic and your balance is not as compromised.
  </div>

  <div class='display-copy'>
    <span class='orange'>The Five Ways of Attack</span> - Even though there are many Martial Arts systems, styles and methods, there are basically only five ways for you to attack or be attacked. In JKD we classify them as:
  </div>

  <div class='display-copy'>
    <span class='orange'>Single Direct Attack/Single Angulated Attack</span> - SDA is a single motion (Punch or Kick) which moves with no effort to conceal it, directly to the target on the most economical route. It can also be indirect, beginning on one line and ending on another. Such as a punch that starts to the stomach (mid line) and ends on the chin (high line). SAA is an attack that is launched from an unanticipated angle that is achieved by moving in such a way as to create an open line into which to strike.
  </div>

  <div class='display-copy'>
    <span class='orange'>Attack by Combination</span> - An offensive attack made up of two or more movements in a natural progression that lands on single or multiple targets. Attack combinations can be comprised of hand to hand, hand to foot, foot to hand and foot to foot strikes.
  </div>

  <div class='display-copy'>
    <span class='orange'>Attack by Draw</span> - The goal when using attack by draw is to "draw" the opponent into a committed attack by baiting them into what looks like an exposed target, then intercepting his/her motion. Or you can execute a motion that invites a counter, then counter attack them as they take your bait.
  </div>

  <div class='display-copy'>
    <span class='orange'>Progressive Indirect Attack</span> - Taken from Western Fencing originally, the idea of "second intention" is employed here where you use an initial false attack or feint to draw some type of defensive reaction from your opponent. After you get the attempted block or parry you deceive that defensive motion by quickly shifting lines and hitting to an open target. Progressive means you will cover at least half the distance between you and your opponent by moving forward on the initial false attack or feint. Indirect means to gain time by putting your opponent a half beat behind your motions. You don't wait for their block to land, you shift lines just as it's moving towards your initial strike. This timing is used to take advantage of the best "window of opportunity" to deceive the opponent.
  </div>

  <div class='display-copy'>
    <span class='orange'>Hand Immobilization Attack</span> - Taken originally from Wing Chun and later modified, "trapping" is an effective tool against systems that block first, then hit. This is an attack that will momentarily immobilize or "trap" one or both of the opponent's arms, allowing you to strike into an open line. You can also purposely draw a reaction from them to be countered with a trap.
