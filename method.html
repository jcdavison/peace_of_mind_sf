    We all have muscle imbalances throughout our bodies, usually due to consistently performing specific tasks and activities. If we choose to ignore these strength and flexability imbalances, we are much more susceptible to injuries.

    By the age of 20, I developed a debilitating repetitive stress injury. I was diagnosed with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands and wrists. Doctors told me that I needed surgery and that my condition would only deteriorate. Over the past 15 years, I have successfully reversed the effects of this debilitating condition by practicing self-healing techniques and Kung Fu. This holistic practice of treating the body has allowed me the full use of my hands again. In 2005, I damaged the ACL in my left knee, preventing me from running and walking. By focusing on strengthening the weaker muscles in my legs, I was able to correct my imbalances and increase stability in my knee joints. I am now able to run again and cycle up to 50 miles a day. In 2007, I separated my AC ligament in my right shoulder in a snow boarding accident. Through proper rehabilitation methodologies and consistent progressive activity, I have regained 100% of my ability and strength.

    Todays new work environment, full of technology and automation, has also contributed to a growing number of physically inactive and dysfunctional people. The average working professional sits in an unnatural posture for hours at a time, and is required to move very little on a daily basis. This decrease in activity often leads to muscular dysfunction, including low back pain, knee injuries, musculoskeletal injuries, and chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, and diabetes. It is wise to combat these negative effects by actively working to discover and correct neuromuscular imbalances in the body. This will greatly reduce your risk of injury, improve your postural alignment, and allow you the freedom to do the activities you love.
