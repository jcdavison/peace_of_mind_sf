    The old adage states, "if you don't use it, you lose it." A good example of this would be to imagine two elderly people; one who is sedentary and one who walks to the park every morning and practices Tai Chi. The difference in their strength and ability to perform everyday tasks would be dramatic. This would be due to the consistency in their everyday activity levels. By incorporating activity into your daily routine and preserving the bodys range of motion, you will increase the quality of your life.
